<p>The exams are <strong>by far</strong> the biggest portion of this class. They <strong>will</strong> be what determines your letter grade.</p>
<p>Feeling a bit anxious the closer you get to the exam? Good! That means you understand the significane of these exams in the class. If this feeling makes you study harder for the exam that&rsquo;s great. However, if this feeling prevents you from wanting to study out of fear then please <a href="/~ves314/#contact">reach out to me</a> ASAP. I completely understand the feeling, and I&rsquo;ll be happy to talk with you about it.</p>
<p>The earlier you start preparing for each exam the better, but it&rsquo;s never too late to practice (unless it&rsquo;s costing you sleep the night before the exam &ndash; sleep will help you far more than any one question can).</p>
<p>In my opinion, you can never prepare enough for the exams. For example, let&rsquo;s say the final is out of 100 points. If you miss 3 points, this is equivelant to missing 9 points on your assignments. Additionally, you get 0 slack points on your final, so if you miss something on any exam it will impact your final grade unlike assignments.</p>
<p>This means if you assume you don&rsquo;t miss any points from assignments (due to slack points), <strong>you&rsquo;ll need a weighted average of at least exactly 90 on what will be likely by far the most difficult exams you&rsquo;ll take this semester in order to get an A in the class.</strong> There are no exceptions to this grading policy.</p>
<p><img src="/~ves314/img/depression.gif?raw=true" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an on target student like I was, you may feel after completing a practice exam, exam 1, or exam 2, reaching this average may feel difficult or borderline impossible. I promise you with enough smart studying and (above all else) hard work you can give yourself a good shot at reaching your goal. It&rsquo;s all up to you!</p>
<h2 id="when-to-start-preparing">
  When to Start Preparing
  <a class="anchor" href="#when-to-start-preparing">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Mike recommends to <strong>begin reviewing 2 weeks before the exam date</strong>. This is the nice medium between learning enough material to understand most of the exam while still giving yourself plenty of time to review. 2 weeks may sound way too far in advanced, but I can assure you from personal experience starting to study a week or less before the exam can you give this sickening feeling of wishing you started earlier. You&rsquo;ll likely start studying more the closer you get to the exam, but please do start looking at the exam ASAP.</p>
<p>Hint: If you&rsquo;re reading this the day it was posted (9/23) two weeks before the exam is TODAY!</p>
<p>If you feel too busy to study but deeply care about your grade in the class please consider temporarily dropping other arrangements you can afford to drop. This is an extremely valuable skill that will serve you very well in CS 439 (Operating Systems). You don&rsquo;t find time, you make time by not doing other things. If you have the time, try watching this time management lecture from Randy Pausch (you may have heard Mike reference him in the past!):</p>

<h2 id="how-much-to-prepare">
  How Much to Prepare
  <a class="anchor" href="#how-much-to-prepare">#</a>
</h2>
<p>As stated above, I don&rsquo;t believe you can over prepare for these exams. These exams almost exclusively test soft skills, so you can&rsquo;t memorize all the information you&rsquo;ll need for the exam. You can only improve these fundamental data structure skills required for the exam by continually identifying mistakes in your thought processes. Mike may not agree with me, but as an on target student, I wish I completed all the past CS 314 exams on Mike&rsquo;s website. Here&rsquo;s how many I did for each exam, and how satisfied I was with my exam grade:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Exam</th>
<th align="left">Practice Exams Completed</th>
<th align="left">Result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">Exam 1</td>
<td align="left">7</td>
<td align="left">:)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Exam 2</td>
<td align="left">6</td>
<td align="left">:'( (Ask Andrew)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Exam 3</td>
<td align="left">14</td>
<td align="left">:DD</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>(For exam 3 I did some CS 307 exams)</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;d recommend to give yourself a good chance of meeting your goal that you should attempt to complete all the exams if you have the time. This sounds impractical, but I think I would have saved myself a lot of stress in this class if I did this. Mike will give his (far more experienced) opinion if you ask.</p>
<p>How much time will this take? For the final I spent around 2-3 full days studying. It&rsquo;s honestly a lot more fun in the GDC with occasionally helping friends and coughing up free soda on the chair used for help hours (ask Andrew), so I empathise with y&rsquo;all having to study for the class remotely. It&rsquo;s honestly not as fun.</p>

  How to Prepare
  <a class="anchor" href="#how-to-prepare">#</a>
</h2>
<h3 id="piazza">
  Piazza
  <a class="anchor" href="#piazza">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Piazza is a very underrated tool for preparing for the exam.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re confused on an exam answer please ask on Piazza. It&rsquo;s the best resource to get fast answers to these questions.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re practicing for your exams please answer exam questions on Piazza. This is an amazing way to force yourself to rubber ducky problems constantly. It helps you straighten up your own skills as you help others. I no-lifed Piazza during Finals week and I truly believe it&rsquo;s the reason I got an A.</p>
<h3 id="order-to-use-practice-exams">
  Order to Use Practice Exams
  <a class="anchor" href="#order-to-use-practice-exams">#</a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Before you do anything else, reserve the most recent 2/3 exams (Fall 18, 19 and Spring 19) for dry runs.</strong> Do not look at these exams for right now. More on that later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d recommend starting on the farthest back exam so that when you finish practicing you&rsquo;ll finish the last exam before the first dry run exam. For example, if you see yourself using 4 practice exams before the dry runs, I&rsquo;d say start at Fall 2016, then work Spring 2018, Fall 2017, and then Spring 2018. Then, do the dry run for Fall 2018, Spring 2019, and then Fall 2019. As another example, if you aim to do all the practice exams I&rsquo;d say start with Fall 2011 and work all the way until Spring 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion, the exams have gotten progressively more difficult as time has continued. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s better to patch the easier mistakes you&rsquo;ll make early on so you can better isolate the harder mistakes on more recent exams. Additionally, you&rsquo;ll get better as you keep practicing, so if you start from recent and go backwards the practice will help less and less over time versus starting far back and progressing to more recent exams.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-practice-exams">
  How to Use Practice Exams
  <a class="anchor" href="#how-to-use-practice-exams">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;d say first do a question and then look at the answer. No timing involved. The one exception to this may be all the short answer questions at the start of the exam and do them all together. The reason for this exception is all the answers are next to each other so if you want to check the answer to 1A you may spoil yourself on the answer to 1B which will lower the quality of your studying.</p>
<p>As for materials, I&rsquo;d say writing your answers in any notebook/loose-leaf paper will work. Mike has recommended printing out the exams in the past, but I didn&rsquo;t since the GDC&rsquo;s printers are slower than my implementation of my heap in OS and I didn&rsquo;t find using a notebook took away anything from studying.</p>
<p>This is the order you should take for a single question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete the question to the best of your ability.
<ul>
<li><strong>DO NOT half-ass it and then check the answer.</strong> You will regret this later when you either run out of practice or, even worse, when you&rsquo;re taking the exam and see a similar question that you now can&rsquo;t remember that <em>one</em> detail to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check the answer. Be VERY nit-picky
<ul>
<li>Make 100% sure on coding questions you got it completely right. If you&rsquo;re not sure please make a public post on Piazza with your submission or ask a friend. <strong>NEVER skim the answer key and assume your solution is valid because they look similar in structure.</strong> You will regret it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you were incorrect with your attempt, understand why you missed it.
<ul>
<li>This is the most important step in studying. <strong>You need to force yourself to understand your mistake well enough to feel 99% confident you&rsquo;ll never miss a question over the same detail on the exam.</strong>
<ul>
<li>This will mean going over lecture slides (briefly &ndash; please don&rsquo;t try to read over all the slides. It won&rsquo;t help) and asking on Piazza. This will sometimes require spending 20 to 30 minutes trying to feel comfortable with what you&rsquo;re missing. I promise you it&rsquo;s worth it.</li>
<li>One thing I wish I tried was writing down in a journal what the <strong>underlying issue</strong> is that led to that mistake.
<ul>
<li><strong>USELESS</strong>: &ldquo;I used .next instead of .next.next silly me&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>USEFUL</strong>: &ldquo;In order to change the next pointer of a singly-linked list, I need to check two nodes in front of me&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s really it for practice. Rinse and repeat for as many exams you can squeeze in.</p>
<h3 id="dry-runs">
  Dry Runs
  <a class="anchor" href="#dry-runs">#</a>
</h3>
<p>These are the sanity checks to let you ballpark how well you&rsquo;ll do on the actual exam. The idea with a dry run is you treat it like a real exam. That involves the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Giving yourself exactly 2 hours (time for the real exam) to complete the dry run</li>
<li>Not letting yourself check answers in between questions. Complete the entire thing and then check the answer key.</li>
<li>No distractions. No music, friends, etc.
<ul>
<li>I think food is okay when you&rsquo;re thinking of how to solve a coding question but if you want to be strict don&rsquo;t let yourself eat/drink either.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can let yourself finish early (unlike the actual exam &ndash; please use the entire time to review your answers. Ask for Mike&rsquo;s story with Jacob(?) turning in his test early with the Connect Four recursive backtracking problem), but otherwise treat it as close to the actual exam as possible.</p>
<p>These will really estimate how we&rsquo;ll you&rsquo;re doing along with giving you the most impactful practice you&rsquo;ll get per question, as you&rsquo;ll find these most recent exams have the hardest questions. You&rsquo;ll learn a lot by doing them.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re still not doing as well as you want, it&rsquo;s not the end of the world. I find, even with dry runs, I do better on the real deal versus dry runs since you can&rsquo;t replicate that feeling of urgency in practice you get on the exam. Wonder if there&rsquo;s a term for this.</p>
<h3 id="what-not-to-do">
  What Not to Do
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-not-to-do">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t let your review be reading over the slides. It won&rsquo;t work.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t spend your time memorizing Big O expressions. You should focus on the soft skill of analyzing an algorithm for its Big O rather than trying to cram them all in your head:
<ul>
<li>USELESS: Quizlet for memorizing ArrayList&rsquo;s Big Os</li>
<li>USEFUL: Looking at GenericList to understand why remove is \(O(N^2)\)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Looking at a question, looking at the answer, and then reasoning why the question&rsquo;s answer is that.
<ul>
<li>You aren&rsquo;t going to remember anything from this. You need to attempt the question first to get the solution to stick in your brain and improve your soft skills</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
