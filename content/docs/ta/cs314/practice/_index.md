# Supplemental Practice for CS 314

This directory covers topics that aren't as focused on in our assignments. The best way to practice for these topics is by running through past exams, but it may be difficult to want to look at exams before we've learned most of the material for them.

So, this page has multiple resources to practice these topics with questions I make or pluck from the internet, along with files to help you check your answers and create your own review!

Practice! Practice! Practice!
