# Supplemental Explanations for CS 314

This directory covers topics that may require some additional explanations. This can be either due to hard examples, or just because a topic may need another listen to for the topic to make sense. If you have any specific requests for supplemental explanations, feel free to contact me [here]({{< relref "/#contact" >}})!
