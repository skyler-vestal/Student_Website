# CS 314 - Data Structures

Hey y'all!

This page is updated for the Fall 2020 session of CS 314. 

If you have any questions about anything (this class, CS, hobbies, etc.) you can reach me with whatever mode of communication works best for you [here]({{< relref "/#contact" >}}).

My main responsibilities for this class include holding discussion and grading assignments for 50895, and answering questions on Piazza and during help hours.

I'm very happy to be here! I love TAing, computer science, and the GDC. We can chat about whatever you want if you're ever bored =)

I also use =) too much on Piazza if you haven't figured that out already.
