    In my free time I enjoy programming, Reddit, video games, anime and 
    I'm starting to learn how to speedcube.

    My favorite videos games are CS:GO, bhop (in CS:GO), and
    Celeste. When I rarely play League of Legends I one-trick Caitlyn.

    My favorite anime BY FAR is Attack on Titan, but Mob Psycho 100
    and Toradora are also way up there for me.

    I've grown up in New Braunfels, Texas, but I was actually
    born in good ol' Wisconsin. :cow:

    I also have experience in Java, Processing, and C.
    I've also used node.js, p5.js, and SQLite for some projects.
