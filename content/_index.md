    In my free time I enjoy programming, roller blading, cooking, and speedcubing.

    I relax by going on Reddit, playing video games, and watching anime.

    My favorite videos games are CS:GO, bhop (in CS:GO), and
    Celeste. When I rarely play League of Legends I one-trick Caitlyn.

    My favorite anime BY FAR is Attack on Titan, but Mob Psycho 100
    and Cowboy Bebop are also way up there for me. (Dinoswarleaf on MAL)

    skyler_vestal@HUGO:~/personality$ cat history.log
    I've grown up in New Braunfels, Texas, but I was actually
    born in good ol' Wisconsin. :cow: 

    skyler_vestal@HUGO:~/personality$ cat lang.txt
    I :heart: :snake: (Python)
    I also have experience in Java, Processing, and C.
    I've also used node.js, p5.js, and SQLite for some projects.
